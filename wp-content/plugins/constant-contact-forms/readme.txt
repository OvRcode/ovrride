Best of all, this plugin is available to all WordPress users, even if you don’t have a Constant Contact account.

**Constant Contact Forms** allows you to:

* Create forms that are clear, simple, and mobile-optimized for every device.
* Choose forms that automatically select the theme and style of your WordPress site.
* Customize data fields, so you can tailor the type of information you collect.

BONUS: If you have a Constant Contact account, all new email addresses that you capture will be automatically added to the Constant Contact email lists of your choosing.

#### How do I include which custom fields labels are which custom field values in my Constant Contact Account?
You can add this to your active theme or custom plugin: `add_filter( 'constant_contact_include_custom_field_label', '__return_true' );`. Note: custom fields have a max length of 50 characters. Including the labels will subtract from the 50 character total available.
