WP SMTP can help us to send emails via SMTP instead of the PHP mail() function. 

== Description ==

WP SMTP can help us to send emails via SMTP instead of the PHP mail() function.
It adds a settings page to "Dashboard"->"Settings"->"WP SMTP" where you can configure the email settings.
There are some examples on the settings page, you can click the corresponding icon to view (such as "Gmail""Yahoo!""Microsoft""163""QQ").
If the field "From" was not a valid email address, or the field "SMTP Host" was left blank, it will not reconfigure the wp_mail() function.

= Usage =

1. Download and extract `wp-smtp.zip` to `wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. "Dashboard"->"Settings"->"WP SMTP"
4. There are some examples on the settings page, you can click the corresponding icon to view.(such as "Gmail""Yahoo!""Microsoft""163""QQ")
