= HOW TO UPGRADE FROM v1.9.* TO 2.0.0 =

**Before upgrading to the latest version 2.0.0, please DO A BACKUP of your custom CSS styles (if any) and read the changelog carefully. Some CSS classes have been renamed, so make sure you apply the correct changes. A brand new Custom CSS Editor is now available to put all of your custom CSS code in just one place.**


**Shortcodes / PHP Code**<br />
If you need to use the Special Recent Posts FREE Edition in another part of your theme which is not widget-handled, **you need shortcodes or PHP code**.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Everything works but i see no thumbnails. =

This issue might be caused by several problems. Please check the following list.

1. First of all, make sure your posts have at least one image inserted in the post content or a featured image assigned. Posts with no images are displayed with the default "No Image" placeholder.
2. Set the correct permissions on the cache folder. In order to generate the thumbnails, the plugin needs to write files in the cache folder, located under special-recent-posts-free/cache/ Be sure this folder is set to 0775 or 0777. Please ask to your system administrator if you're not sure what you are doing.
3. Thumbnails are rendered using the PHP GD libraries. These should be enabled on your server. Do a phpinfo() on your host to check if they're installed properly. Contact your hosting support to know how to enable them.
4. Another problem could be that you're hosting the plugin on a MS Windows based machine. This will probably change the encoding data inside the files and could lead to several malfunctions. Better to host your site on a Unix/Linux based environment.
5. If you're using some **CDN service like Photon from the Jetpack plugin**, be aware that images hosted on a different domain could lead to potential malfunctions. In this case, Special Recent Posts FREE Edition will try to do its best to display your images, but sometimes this can't be done. Please consider to switch off the Jetpack Photon Extension.

= Category Filtering isn't working. / How do i find a category ID to filter posts by? =

In order to properly filter posts by categories, you must provide a numeric value which is the Category ID.
Every Wordpress category has an unique identification number, and this can be found doing the following steps:

1. Go in the  Posts->Categories panel.
2. Mouse over a category name.
3. Look at the status bar at the very bottom of your browser window: you'll find a long string containing a parameter called **tag_ID** and its following value.
4. Take note of that number, which is the relative Category ID to insert in the SRP FREE filtering panel.


**NOTE**: Please remember that this procedure is also valid for post filtering, where instead of category IDs, you have to look for your post IDs by hovering with the mouse on their titles.

= The widget title looks awful. How can i display it just like all other widgets? =

In this case, you have to deactivate the default SRP behaviour which customizes the widget title with custom HTML headings and styles.

1. Go to your Special Recent Posts FREE Edition widget under the "**Layout Options**".
2. Turn on the "**Use Default Wordpress HTML Layout for Widget Title**" option.

== Requirements ==

In order to work, Special Recent Posts FREE Edition plugin needs the following settings:

1. Wordpress release 3.0+
2. PHP version 5+
3. GD libraries installed and enabled on your server.
4. Correct permissions (0775 or 0777) on cache folder under special-recent-posts-free/cache
