2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings -&gt; Special Recent Posts FREE page to configure the global options.
4. In the widgets panel, drag the Special Recent Posts FREE Edition widget onto one of your sidebars and configure its specific settings.
5. You're done. Enjoy.

If you wish to use the Special Recent Posts in another part of your theme which is not widget-handled, you can put the following snippet:

		special_recent_posts($args);
	}
?>
`
where $args is an array of the following options:

`

Example:

`
<?php
// Defining widget options.
$args = array(
	'post_limit'       => 5,
	'post_random'      => 'yes',
	'category_include' => 3, 7
);


// Function call.
special_recent_posts($args);
?>
`

If you wish to use a shortcode, put the following inside any of your post/pages:
`[srp]`

Shortcodes parameters names are the same of direct PHP call ones, but you have to put them with the '=' sign instead of the '=>' arrow.
String values must be enclosed within single/double quotes.

Example:
`[srp post_limit='5' post_random='yes' category_include=3,7]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

<p>
Please refer to the online Help Desk available at <a href="http://www.specialrecentposts.com/support">http://www.specialrecentposts.com/support</a> for a complete support and knowledge base.
</p>

= How do i edit the CSS? =

The stylesheet is located at wp-content/plugins/special-recent-posts/assets/css/css-front.css

= Everything works but i see no thumbnails. Only the "no image" placeholder =

This issue might be caused by several problems. Check the following list.
<ol>
<li>First of all, make sure the relative post has at least one image inserted in its text content or a featured image assigned. Posts with no images are displayed with the default "no image" placeholder.</li>
<li>Set the correct permissions on the cache folder. In order to generate the thumbnails, the plugin needs to write in the cache folder, located under special-recent-posts/cache/
Be sure this folder is set to 0775 or 0777. Please ask to your system administrator if you're not sure what you are doing.</li>
<li>Thumbnails are rendered using the PHP GD libraries. These should be enabled on your server. Do a phpinfo() on your host to check if they're installed properly. Contact your hosting support to know how to enable them.</li>
<li>Another problem could be that you're hosting the plugin on a MS Windows based machine. This will probably change the encoding data inside the files and could lead to several malfunctions. Better to host your site on a Unix/Linux based environment.</li>
<li>External images are not allowed. This means that if you're trying to generate a thumbnail from an image hosted on a different domain, it just won't work. This is usually not allowed for security reasons.</li>
</ol>

= Category/Post filtering isn't working =

In order to properly filter posts by categories, you must provide a numeric value which is the Category ID.
Every Wordpress category has an unique Identification number, and this can be found doing the following steps:
<ol>
<li>Go in the  Posts->Categories panel</li>
<li>Mouse over a category name.</li>
<li>Look at the status bar at the very bottom of your browser window. There you will find a long string containing a parameter called <strong>tag_ID</strong> and its following value.</li>
<li>Take note of that number, which is the relative Category ID to insert in the SRP PRO filtering panel.</li>
</ol>

NOTE: Please remember that this procedure is also valid for post filtering.
