WooCommerce is a powerful, extendable eCommerce plugin that helps you sell anything. Beautifully.

== Description ==

Transform your WordPress website into a thorough-bred eCommerce store. Delivering enterprise-level quality and features whilst backed by a name you can trust. Say "hello" to the WooCommerce eCommerce plugin.

WooCommerce is built by the experienced folk at WooThemes who also offer premium [eCommerce themes](http://www.woothemes.com/product-category/themes/woocommerce/ "eCommerce themes from WooThemes") and [extensions](http://www.woothemes.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/ "eCommerce extensions for WooCommerce from WooThemes") to further enhance your shopfront.

= STRENGTH & FLEXIBILITY =
WooCommerce is built using WordPress best practises both on the front and the back end. This results in an efficient, robust and intuitive plugin.

= SMART DASHBOARD WIDGETS & REPORTS =
Keep a birds-eye view of incoming sales and reviews, stock levels and general store performance and statistics all from the WordPress dashboard or go to the reports section to view stats in more detail.

= CUSTOMIZABLE =
Your business is unique, your online store should be too. Choose one of our [eCommerce themes](http://www.woothemes.com/product-category/themes/woocommerce/ "eCommerce themes from WooThemes") or build your own and give it a personal touch using the built in shortcodes and widgets.

WooCommerce works with any theme, including the default WordPress themes Twenty Ten, Twenty Eleven and Twenty Twelve. If you need help getting your theme working nicely with WooCommerce please read our [theming docs](http://docs.woothemes.com/document/third-party-custom-theme-compatibility/) to discover your options.

= FEATURES =
Whether you're operating a superstore selling thousands of products, or a just a sole trader selling hand made arts and crafts WooCommerce has you covered. You can read all about WooCommerce' features on the [WooCommerce website](http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/ "WooCommerce: An open-source eCommerce plugin for WordPress").

= GET INVOLVED =

Developers can checkout and contribute to the source code on the [WooCommerce GitHub Repository](https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.5 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater
* Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WooCommerce” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our eCommerce plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you’re sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our eCommerce plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Upgrading =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.

= Dummy data =

WooCommerce comes with some dummy data you can use to see how products look; either import dummy_data.xml via the [WordPress importer](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-importer/) or use our [CSV Import Suite plugin](http://www.woothemes.com/products/product-csv-import-suite/) to import dummy_data.csv and dummy_data_variations.csv.
