== Description ==
Facebook Like Box Widget is a social plugin that enables Facebook Page owners to attract and gain Likes & Recommendation Comments from their own website. The Like Box enables users to: see how many users already like this page, and which of their friends like it too, read recent posts from the page and Like the page with one click, without needing to visit the page.

Updated: 
With the release of Graph API v.2.3 the Like Box plugin is deprecated => Facebook: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-box-for-pages

On Facebook Like Box Widget 2.8, I have added Facebook Page Plugin that allows you to embed a simple feed of content from a Page into your websites.
You still can continue to use Facebook Like Box as Facebook mentioned if you continue to use Like Box plugin, it will automatically fall back to the Page Plugin by June 23rd 2015.
