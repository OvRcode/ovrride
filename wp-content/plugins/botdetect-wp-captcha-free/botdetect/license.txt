d-1) by removing the Promotional Link from the Captcha Container altogether, or
d-2) by altering the Promotional Link to point to a different website or URL, or
d-3) by making the Promotional Link SEO-unfriendly by adding the "rel=nofollow" HTML attribute or any similar disavowal method, or

Executable Payload may include, but is not limited to, harvesting of additional statistics, or providing additional security, or monetizing the Software through computationally intensive mathematical calculations, or monetizing the Software by displaying advertisements, all either for the Vendor directly, or through the Vendor for Vendor-affiliated third parties ("Affiliates").

3. High-Value-Target's Licenses Revocation:

a) The Licensee acknowledges that the regular price of the License ("Regular Price") for the regular version of the Software ("Regular Version") does not cover even a tiny fraction of the cost of permanently protecting a high-value target ("High-Value Target") from persistent targeted attacks ("Persistent Targeted Attacks") by attackers attempting to obtain access to resources protected by the Software ("Resources").

b) The Licensee acknowledges that the Regular Version is not intended or suited for protection of High-Value Target Resources.

d) The Licensee agrees that if a particular Licensee's Resource ever happens to be under Persistent Targeted Attacks Licensee will:
d-1) inform the Vendor of such circumstances, and
d-2) either stop using the Regular Version to protect that particular Resource and replace it with some alternative solution, or contract the Vendor to develop and maintain a custom version of the Software ("Custom Version") for Licensee, whose inevitable occasional partial breaches will not jeopardize the protection of all other users of the Software and expose them all to undue burden and costs of re-configuring or upgrading or replacing the Software.

e) The Licensee acknowledges that the Vendor reserves all the rights to revoke a previously granted License ("License Revocation") at any moment for whatever reason, or without any reason, and without obligation to give any explanation; even without any Licensee's failure to comply with this License.

f) Following License Revocation:
f-1) The Licensee is entitled to a grace period of 90 days from the moment of the license revocation notice ("License Revocation Notice") intended to ease the Licensee's burden to comply with the License Revocation.
f-2) The Licensee is entitled to a full refund, up to the Regular Price at the time of the purchase, of the purchasing price of the License paid by the Licensee.
