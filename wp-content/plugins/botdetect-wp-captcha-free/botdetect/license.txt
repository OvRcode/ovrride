By using the Software and subsequently the Captcha Challenges, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
Vendor provides the Software as individual implementations for different technologies, as per instance ASP, ASP.NET, PHP, Java, etc. (the "Technologies"). The Software is licensed separately for each individual Technology.
Licensee acknowledges that they are licensed to use the Software only in those Technologies for which Licensee purchased (or otherwise obtained) the License.
If you do not agree with the terms of this Agreement, you are not licensed to use the Software and Captcha Challenges, and you must delete and/or destroy any copies of the Software and Captcha Challenges in your possession or control.
