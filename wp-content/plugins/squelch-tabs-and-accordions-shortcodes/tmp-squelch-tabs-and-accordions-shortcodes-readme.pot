msgid "The plugin was banned from the WordPress.org directory for providing jQuery from the Google CDN and allowing the user to choose the version of jQuery they wanted to run on their site. Apparently this contravenes the WordPress.org directory guidelines, despite the fact that the guidelines seem to make no mention of jQuery anywhere and despite the fact there are a number of plugins in the directory that do exactly the same thing. In order to get the plugin relisted it was necessary to use the WordPress-hosted version of jQuery and package the jQuery UI theme files. As a result the plugin no longer works on WP&lt;3.5 and there's not much I can do about that."

msgid "Mostly compatible, yes. The initial goal of the plugin was to provide compatibility with that plugin as a way for those who've been left stranded by the demise of TheThe Tabs and Accordions plugin to continue using their accordions, horizontal accordions, tabs and toggles. I've changed some of the defaults for the widgets from what TheThe Tabs and Accordions used so if you've not been explicit when creating shortcodes you may notice some changes. I believe the defaults are better and more in line with what most people will want. Also, some minor functionality has still not been implemented so if you rely on those functions you might spot a few inconsistencies. Feel free to raise a support request on the plugin forum if functionality you require is missing."

msgid "If you're on an older version of WordPress and still want to use the plugin then you will need to load a newer version of jQuery and jQuery UI. jQuery is pretty straightforward to upgrade (see the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/jquery-updater/\">jQuery updater plugin</a>) but I've not been able to find a plugin that does the same thing for jQuery UI. Maybe if I can find time I'll write a plugin that offers this functionality, if I can get it past certain members of the WordPress.org plugin review team. It's also possible to add some code to your theme to achieve this goal, I'll try and put some documentation together for this shortly."
